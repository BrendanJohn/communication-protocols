CSCI S-40 Communication Protocols and Internet ArchitecturesHomework 2Brendan Murphy	•	In an Ethernet environment, a broadcast domain is a group of devices who are capable of receiving a broadcast frame sent from one node to the group. A collision domain is any place where these devices or nodes are contending for access to the network and collisions may occur. It's possible for two devices to attempt to send a frame at the same time which will result in a collision. A hub is a layer one device that broadcasts a frame to every one of its ports, the hub has no way of distinguishing which port to send a frame to and therefore extends the collision domain. When replaced with a switch, smaller collision domains are created between each node and its port to reduce the overall size of the collision domain. Routers can separate broadcast domains by forwarding IP datagrams based on IP addresses, making it the ideal network device to reduce the overall size of broadcast domains and collision domains. 1b) The easiest solution I can think of would be directly connect the 5 mail/file servers to 5 of the 8 physical Ethernet ports. My rationale for this decision is to take advantage of slightly faster communication speeds over a wired connection to serve up the content of these machines to the network quicker so that my business runs smoothly. The remaining devices on the network are the 10 desktop machines, I would connect three of them to the 3 open ports where it makes sense based on the physical layout of the office. To reduce installation costs for my business I would choose the three desktops that are in closest proximity to the router. The 7 remaining machines should connect to the network via their wireless Ethernet cards. 1c) Although a server and a desktop are in some ways very similar, under the hood one has a more complex workload and requires more forethought when connecting to a network. This is because a server is serving up content to many end users, and downtime can have costly impacts on business and must be thoroughly analyzed and implemented with care. A desktop does not serve up content to the network as frequently and can be assumed to have less network traffic than a server, for this reason it may have less processing power than a server.	•	Packets sent from one computer to another on a network are transmitted and retransmitted by a variety of different routers along its path. The traceroute command traces the route that packets take between a user's system and a destination. It displays the results as a list of IP addresses representing each hop that the packet took on the journey towards its destination. Traceroute accomplishes this by exploiting the Time To Live Field of probe packets. Working iteratively, traceroute begins by sending out a packet with a time to live of one causing the first router on the path to drop the packet and send a failure message back revealing its IP address. Traceroute increments the time to live of each packet and continues until it receives a 'port unreachable' message indicating that the host has been reached. The full list of IP addresses is compiled and displayed to the user within the command prompt window.	•	The Internet Protocol is the method used when sending data from one device to another over the internet, for this to be possible every device needs a global address. An Internet Protocol address is a unique numeric code assigned to every device connected to a computer network that uses internet protocol for data transmissions.IP addresses are necessary despite the fact that every Network Interface Card contains a unique MAC address. This is true because a MAC address (Media Access Control) provides a unique hardware address for every node on the network, but it does not provide the location of the node or any routing information. An IP address is designed to make routing possible by providing two components within its address: a host identifier and a network identifier. The network identifier is the crucial component that differentiates it from a MAC address in the sense that it provides location specific information. This is why every machine needs to have a unique IP address in addition to a unique MAC address on its Network Interface Card.	•	A switch is a layer two network device that processes frames and forwards them based on MAC address. The switch stores an incoming frame's MAC address in an internal table along with the port number that the frame was received on.  It also reads in the destination MAC address, if it is unable to find that MAC address on the internal table it will send the frame out to all ports minus the port it was received on. Switch operations at the following events are as follows:	•	Host A sends a frame to host C. Based on the rules outlined above, the switch will see that host A sent a frame to host C from port 1. It will then review its internal table and see that the destination MAC address of the frame does not exist. Therefore it will send the frame to every port except port 1. The internal table of the switch will now have a record indicating that host A is connected to port 1, and a new record for the MAC address of the outgoing frame's destination.	•	Host D sends out a broadcast frame. Based on the rules outlined above, the switch will see that host D sent a frame port 4. Since this is a broadcast frame with no specific destination address, it will send the frame to every port except port 4. The internal table of the switch will now have a record indicating that host D is connected to port 4.	•	Host C sends a frame back to host A. Based on the rules outlined above, the switch will see that host C sent a frame to host A from port 3. It will then review its internal table and see that Host A is connected to port A. Therefore it will send the frame out on port 1. The internal table of the switch will now have a record indicating that host C is connected to port 3.	•	The star of star Ethernet switch layout has several points of failure. To overcome this, a savvy network admin suggests connecting the stars together with additional Ethernet cables, effectively creating a layer two topological loop. This would introduce two key problems in the network, first a possible corruption in the forwarding internal tables of each device, and secondly a possible broadcast storm.	A corruption of internal forwarding tables occurs in any network with many redundant paths. 	When a device on the network sends out a frame and it is received by two or more switches 	simultaneously, given that these two switches are also connected would create the illusion that 	the sending device has multiple MAC addresses. The will result in frame loss or even multiple 	copies of the same frame arriving from different paths or ports.	A broadcast storm occurs in a network loop with more than one switch connected to the 	same network. When one device on the network sends out a broadcast frame, the	receiving switch then floods the frame out to the network, however the frame is picked up by 	another connected switch who also broadcasts the frame and the chain continues based on the 	size and complexity of the network. These frames may even be passed around endlessly 	resulting in sever network congestion.	•	Answers to question 6 below:	•	There a few different topologies that are commonly used in Local Area Networks (LAN). In a Bus topology each computer is connected to a common line, this is ideal for very small networks. A Mesh topology includes sets of nodes with established point-to-point connections, these nodes work together to distribute network data. A Mesh topology should be considered when creating a wireless network. A Point-to-Point network is a very simple topology that connects just two machines. In a Ring topology, each node is connected to exactly two other nodes forming a ring. This forms an efficient and continuous path for signal transmission. In a Star topology, each node connects directly to a central network switch, which controls all functions of the network. A Star topology is advantageous because it is easy to setup and install new nodes, and also easy to detect and swap out faulty ones.	•	Network topologies can be described as either physical or logical. The physical topology of a network describes how the physical objects of a network are laid out, this includes the computers, servers, wires, switches and any other device physically connected to the network. The logical topology of a network addresses how data flows through the network.	•	Protocol software is the software responsible for sending data from an application on one computer to another device on the network. This software can be abstracted out into different layers of responsibility, with each layer handling one piece of the data transmission process. There  are differing schools of thought as to what the correct number of layers in the reference model should be.4 Layer modelResponsibilityApplication LayerApplications and programs such as emailTransport LayerProvides end-to-end reliabilityInternet LayerHandles communication from one machine to anotherNetwork Access LayersResponsible for handling incoming packets5 Layer modelResponsibilityApplication LayerApplications and programs such as emailTransport LayerProvides end-to-end reliabilityNetwork Access LayersResponsible for handling incoming packetsData LinkTransfers data between adjacent networksPhysicalElectronic circuit transmissions7 Layer modelResponsibilityApplication LayerApplications and programs such as emailPresentation LayerServes as the data translatorSession LayerProvides mechanism for opening and closing a sessionTransport LayerProvides host-to-host communicationsNetwork LayerResponsible for packet forwardingData LinkTransfers data between adjacent networksPhysicalElectronic circuit transmissionsThe original 7-layer OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model dates back to 1974 and is crucial for understanding the complex process of data communications. By breaking down each unique process in the networking model the OSI model  helps users see the big picture in data communications and also makes troubleshooting network issues easier by breaking down responsibilities into smaller pieces.The 4-layer TCP/IP model is an improvement over the 7-layer model and in my opinion is the optimal network reference model. One of the major drawbacks of the OSI models is the inherently complexity of a 7-layer reference model. The TCP/IP model does not distinguish between the top three layers (application, presentation, session) and each is fully represented by the application layer alone. Furthermore, the 4-layer model eliminates the need for the data link layer which is present in both the 7-layer model and 5-layer model. This simplistic approach makes the model easier to understand and proves that the layers in the TCP/IP model are less rigid than the OSI model. Lastly, the real benefit of the TCP/IP reference model is that it is more in line with modern network implementations.
