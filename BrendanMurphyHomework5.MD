	•	The CAN-SPAM act was a law passed in 2003 that outlined the first national strategy to standardize the requirements to send commercial messages, also putting in place firm penalties for those who fail to comply. CAN-SPAM section 5.a.5 requires all bulk email senders to require an opt-out link on all documents, however clicking on these opt-out links may actually be counterproductive for the email recipient. Unfortunately, talented email spammers may put code into the email that detects when the opt-out link has been clicked. This will tell the spammers that the email address is active and accurate, and can also serve as a covert downloading link allowing the spammer to download unwanted or malicious software onto the user's machine.

	•	Access Control Lists (ACL) are a type of packet filter that can limit network traffic by determining which routed packets are forwarded or blocked at the router's interface. Packet filtering increases security by restricting certain types of traffic into a given network and limiting the amount of traffic leaving a network. The access list a sequential list that consists of source and destination address information, protocol details, port numbers and at least one permit statement and one or more deny statements encompassing the filtering rules. 

Routers evaluate access control lists from top to bottom, the sequence is important. Every packet on the network gets evaluated against the list either permitting or denying the packet as it moves down the list. If at any point a packet is denied access because of a rule in the list, it is discarded and cannot be allowed to proceed even if a later rule would have permitted it. Most of the home and small business routers I researched online had a simple GUI to create access control lists, however some of Cisco's more high end routers have a command line interface to create them.

Take the Cisco ASR 903 router for example (MSRP around $2,000). This huge router has some advanced networking features that are configurable using the command line. This is how we could deny all hosts on network 172.22.1.0 using the ACL.
 1.    enable 

2.    configure terminal 

3.    ip access-list standard sample deny

4.    remark deny some network

5.    deny 172.22.1.0
	 
6.    end 

7.    show ip access-list

	•	X.509 is a standard for defining the format of a public key certificate. The X.509 certificate was originally created in 1988 as part of a directory called X.500 to help early internet users navigate digital directories. Today, the X.509 certificate helps users identify secure connections by harnessing the X.509 public key infrastructure standard to verify that a public key and a hostname, organization or individual are connected. These key pairs ensure privacy and legitimacy in an online world that is increasing under attack by malicious parties, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. In the simplest terms, it confirms that a given person is who they say they are. Every certificate contains the following:
	•	Distinguished Name (DN)
	•	public key
	•	serial number
	•	digital signature
	•	details about the algorithm
	•	an issuer DN

Every certificate is either self-signed or signed by a certificate authority. A certificate authority is an entity that issues digital certificates and acts as a trusted third party that is trusted by the owner of the certificate and the party relying on the certificate. The certificate authorities are needed to verify the private/public keys because anyone can actually generate these key pairs on their own. Certificate Authorities also make their public keys available, using certificates signed by higher level certificate authorities in a hierarchy used to maximize security. The hierarchical system ensures that there is an unbroken chain of trust between the certificate issued and the root certificate authority, itself made trustworthy by some other mechanism apart from a certificate.

	•	Digital signatures, much like handwritten signatures are unique to the person signing the document. A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for endorsing the authenticity of a digital message. This signature gives the receiver of a signed message reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender, that the message was not altered during transmission, and the sender cannot deny sending the message.

Digital signatures are generated when a signer electronically signs a document and they are created using the signer's public key algorithm and a special hashing function . A hashing algorithm creates data matching the signed document resulting in a encrypted data that is the digital signature. When submitting my homework via email, this methodology would be used to sign and submit my homework: I complete my homework and digitally sign it, creating a hash of the document using a hashing function. This hash is very specific to the document I am submitting and cannot be duplicated. The hash code is then encrypted using my private key, this is combined with my public key to create a digital signature which is included in the document. When the document reaches a teaching assistant at Harvard, they open it with a digital-signature capable program which uses my public key to decrypt the document hash. This program then calculates a new hash code for the document and if this new hash matches the decrypted hash the program can state with some certainty that the document has not been altered in any way since it appended with my digital signature.

	•	In computer networks a proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients and network resources, improving various aspects of the process such as performance and security. A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy server is an intermediary between SIP devices aiding in point-to-point communications like call routing between SIP devices. The SIP proxy server may also perform other tasks including network access control, authorization and handling network security.
	In a network supporting Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) , a SIP proxy server is configured to 	complete the tasks associated with finding the destination of a call. When a IP phone creates a 	call, it is actually sending an INVITE request to a proxy server. The IP phone does not know what 	the digits typed into it actually mean, but the proxy server does. The proxy server acts as an 	outbound server and finds the proxy network supporting the destination, updates the INVITE 	and passes it along to the remote proxy. The remote proxy supporting the destination IP phone 	could be something like the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)). The remote proxy 	server then accepts the INVITE and locates the destination IP phone on the network. The INVITE 	is then passed directly to the IP phone where it is either accepted or denied. However, To 	complete the call the remote proxy server must first determine the location information by 	requesting it from location service.
	Locating the destination SIP phone requires the usage of an abstract service called the location 	service that provides address bindings for a particular domain. The address bindings are 	registered by the client within the SIP registry server, this registration process is completed 	when the SIP phone or other endpoint sends an SIP REGISTER command to the SIP Server. This 	command contains the contact details of the endpoint including IP address. The SIP registry 	service then sends this information to the location service, allowing a proxy server to locate the 	given SIP phone/device.	

	•	Having recently implemented a Layer 2 switching environment in a network that uses OpenFlow, what follows is a description of what happens when a packet enters the switch and a lookup is done in the switch, but no match is found. OpenFlow is a programmable communications protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network router or switch over a network. An OpenFlow switch handles the flow of similar packets by routing them through one or more flow tables that will perform packet lookups and forwarding.  When a packet arrives, a table lookup is performed in the first flow table. A packet matches a flow table entry if the values in the packet match any fields defined in the flow table entry, these values differ by packet type but typically include various header fields. Some of the default match fields in the OpenFlow specifications are: Ethernet frame type, IP protocol, TCP source port, IPv4 destination address and Ipv4 source address. After matching, the counters of the selected flow entry must be updated and the instruction set included in the selected flow entry must be adhered to. When no match is found, the packet is processed through a table-miss flow entry.
	Table-miss flow entry must be supported in OpenFlow and it specifies how to process packets 	that are unmatched by other flow entries in the flow table and may send packets to the 	controller, drop packets or direct packets to a subsequent table. A table-miss flow entry is 	identified by its match and its priority, it subsequently omits all matching fields and has the 	lowest priority in the flow table. One possible option for table-miss packets is a direct routing 	toward the controller using the reserved controller port. These packets must identify as table-	misses. Another possible option for unmatched packets is that they are discarded when there is 	no table-miss flow entry present, this may have occurred if the controller removed the table-	miss flow entry or it has expired. There is also a configuration in the switch which allows for 	specific default behavior to occur in the case of unmatched packets using the OpenFlow 	Configuration Protocol.
	•	Extra Credit: I setup my iptel username and was able to listen to music etc - but was never able to connect to sip:cs40@iptel.org- the connection just hangs and I can`t hear anything. My iptel name is: sip:BrendanJCSCI40@iptel.org
